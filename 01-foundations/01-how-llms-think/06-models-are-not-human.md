## **Why we should NOT treat the model like a human**

---

### Core truth (everything comes from this)

> **The model does not understand — it predicts**

It does not:

* care
* intend
* try
* get confused
* “want” to help

It only chooses the **next most likely token**.

---

### Why human-style talking fails

When you talk to a human, you rely on:

* shared common sense
* implied meaning
* emotional signals
* context “between the lines”

The model has **none of that**.

If something is not **explicitly written**,
it does **not exist**.

---

### Politeness & emotions don’t work

Words like:

* please
* carefully
* very important
* don’t mess up

carry **no control power**.

They don’t change behavior
unless they become **rules or constraints**.

---

### Fluency creates a dangerous illusion

The model sounds confident and clear, so we assume:

* it understands
* it reasons like us

It doesn’t.

Fluency is just a **language pattern**, not intelligence.

---

### The correct mental shift

❌ “How would I explain this to a person?”
✅ “How do I constrain a probabilistic system?”

---

### One-line summary (remember this)

> **Treat the model like software, not a human**

That’s the entire idea.
