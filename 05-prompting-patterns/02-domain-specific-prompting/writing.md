### Writing

**The unique challenge:** Writing requires creativity, voice, style consistency, and audience awareness - elements that are highly subjective and context-dependent.

**Key principles for writing prompts:**

**1. Define voice and style explicitly**

```
Write a blog post about [topic] in this style:

VOICE:
- Tone: Conversational but authoritative
- Perspective: First-person plural ("we")
- Energy: Enthusiastic without being salesy
- Vocabulary: Accessible to educated laypersons (avoid jargon)

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Sentence length: Mix of short (impact) and medium (explanation)
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max
- Use active voice predominantly
- Include rhetorical questions to engage reader
- Subheadings every 200-300 words

SIMILAR TO: [Example writer or publication]
NOT LIKE: [Counter-example]
```

**2. Provide writing samples for style matching**

```
Here are three examples of our brand voice:

EXAMPLE 1:
[paste excerpt]

EXAMPLE 2:
[paste excerpt]

EXAMPLE 3:
[paste excerpt]

Now write [new content] matching this exact style. Pay attention to:
- How we structure arguments
- Our use of humor/metaphors
- Sentence rhythm and pacing
- How we address the reader
```

**3. Specify structure and format**

```
Write a 1,500-word article on [topic]:

STRUCTURE:
1. Hook (50 words)
   - Open with surprising statistic or provocative question
   - Establish why this matters now

2. Problem Setup (300 words)
   - Define the problem clearly
   - Show real-world impact
   - Relate to reader's experience

3. Solution Framework (800 words)
   - Present 3-4 key solutions
   - For each: explanation, example, actionable tip
   - Use subheadings for each solution

4. Implementation (250 words)
   - Step-by-step getting started guide
   - Anticipate common obstacles

5. Conclusion (100 words)
   - Reinforce key takeaway
   - End with call-to-action

FORMATTING:

- End each major section with transition
```

**4. Audience-specific writing**

```
Rewrite this technical explanation for three different audiences:

Original text: [paste technical content]

VERSION 3 - For end users:

- Length: 300 words, very accessible
```

**5. Iterative refinement**

```

[generate first draft]

CRITIQUE: Analyze what works and what doesn't

```

**6. SEO-optimized content**

```

SECONDARY KEYWORDS: [keyword 1], [keyword 2], [keyword 3]

SEO REQUIREMENTS:

4. JOURNEY: Follow their path to solution
5. RESOLUTION: Show transformation
6. LESSON: Extract universal insight

```

**8. Different content types**

**Writing quality checks:**

- Does each paragraph have one clear point?

ENGAGEMENT:

If any area scores low, suggest specific improvements.
