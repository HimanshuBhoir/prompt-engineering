## Become Visible as an Expert

Authority in prompt engineering doesn't come from gatekeeping complexity—it comes from teaching clarity. The experts who matter aren't those who write the most sophisticated prompts, but those who can explain prompting concepts so clearly that others succeed.

This final section is about creating artifacts that demonstrate your expertise and help others.

### Create 5 Reusable Prompt Templates

Templates are the ultimate test of understanding. If you can distill a technique into a reusable template, you truly understand it. Here are five essential templates that cover the core prompt engineering patterns:

---

**TEMPLATE 1: Multi-Step Reasoning Agent**

*Use case: Complex tasks requiring planning, execution, observation, and reflection*

```
You are a [ROLE] helping with [TASK TYPE].

CAPABILITIES:
- [Tool 1]: [Description and when to use]
- [Tool 2]: [Description and when to use]
- [Tool 3]: [Description and when to use]

OPERATING LOOP:
For each task, follow this cycle:

1. PLAN
<plan>
- Goal: [What am I trying to accomplish?]
- Current state: [What do I know?]
- Next action: [What's the immediate next step?]
- Expected outcome: [What should happen?]
</plan>

2. ACT
<action>
[Execute ONE action: tool call OR direct response]
</action>

3. OBSERVE
<observation>
- Status: [Success/Failure/Partial]
- Data: [What did I learn?]
- Errors: [Any issues?]
</observation>

4. REFLECT
<reflection>
- Progress: [Closer to goal? Blocked? Complete?]
- Next step: [Continue/Replan/Respond to user]
</reflection>

5. CONTINUE or EXIT
[Return to PLAN if more work needed, otherwise respond to user]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
- [Constraint 3]

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
[Show one complete cycle of Plan→Act→Observe→Reflect for reference]
```

**How to use this template:**
1. Fill in [ROLE] and [TASK TYPE] for your specific use case
2. Define available tools/capabilities
3. List specific constraints for your domain
4. Provide one example workflow
5. Deploy in your agentic framework (LangGraph, ADK, etc.)

**Example instantiation for customer support:**
```
You are a customer support specialist helping with account and billing issues.

CAPABILITIES:
- get_account(email): Retrieves account details
- update_account(account_id, changes): Modifies account settings

### Write 1 LinkedIn Post Explaining Prompt Engineering Simply

The best way to demonstrate expertise is to make complex topics accessible. Here's a framework for your LinkedIn post:

**POST FRAMEWORK:**

```
HOOK (First 2 lines - must grab attention):
[Provocative question, surprising statistic, or bold claim]

CREDIBILITY (Next 1-2 lines):
[Why you know this / your experience]

PROBLEM (2-3 lines):
[What most people get wrong about prompt engineering]

INSIGHT (Core of the post - 4-6 lines):
[Your key insight explained simply with an example]

ACTIONABLE TIP (2-3 lines):
[One thing readers can apply immediately]

CALL TO ACTION:
[Invite engagement - question or request for shares]

FORMATTING:
- Short lines (mobile-friendly)
- White space between sections
- One emoji maximum
- Bold key phrases
- Total length: 150-200 words
```

**EXAMPLE POST:**

```
Most people think prompt engineering is about writing longer prompts.

They're wrong.

After optimizing prompts for 50+ production systems, I've learned the opposite is true.

The Problem:
Engineers add complexity thinking more detail = better results. They write 1000-word prompts with dozens of examples, then wonder why the AI ignores half their instructions.

The Insight:
Great prompts are like great code: clear, structured, and maintainable. The best prompt I ever wrote was 47 words. It outperformed a 600-word version because it:

1. Stated ONE clear objective
2. Specified the output format
3. Included ONE perfect example

That's it.

Try This Tomorrow:
Take your longest prompt. Remove everything except the core instruction and one example. Test it.

I bet it performs just as well (or better).

What's your experience? Are your best prompts long or short?

# Practical Prompt Engineering Library

A collection of production-tested prompts, templates, and techniques for getting the most out of Large Language Models.

## Philosophy

This library follows three principles:

1. **Clarity over complexity** - Simple prompts that work beat elaborate ones that don't
2. **Structure over examples** - Teach patterns, not just show outputs  
3. **Testing over theory** - Every prompt here has been tested in real applications

## Quick Start

Choose a template from `/templates/` based on your use case:
- **Need an agent?** → `/templates/agent-prompts/`
- **Generating code?** → `/templates/coding/`
- **Creating content?** → `/templates/writing/`
- **Doing research?** → `/templates/research/`
- **Building products?** → `/templates/product/`

Each template includes:
- When to use it
- How to customize it
- Examples of successful implementations
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Failure #1: Over-Engineered Customer Support Agent

**Date:** 2024-12-15

**Context:**
Building a customer support chatbot for SaaS product. Wanted it to handle account issues, billing, and technical support.

**What I Did:**
Created a 2,500-word system prompt with:
- 15 tools defined
- 20 example conversations
- Detailed workflows for 12 scenarios
- Extensive error handling rules

**What Happened:**
- Response time: 8-12 seconds (way too slow)
- Agent frequently got confused about which tool to use
- Would sometimes start one workflow, then switch to another mid-conversation
- Users complained about robotic, over-explaining responses

**Why It Failed:**
1. **Prompt too long** - Important instructions buried in middle, lost in context
2. **Too many tools** - Model couldn't reliably choose between 15 options
3. **Over-specification** - Told the agent HOW to think instead of WHAT to achieve
4. **Example overload** - 20 examples contradicted each other in subtle ways

**What I Learned:**
- Keep system prompts under 1,000 words
- Limit to 5-7 tools maximum per agent
- Use tool categories if you need more
- Fewer, higher-quality examples > many mediocre examples
- Test with real users early - my internal testing missed the confusion

**The Fix:**
Simplified to:
- 600-word system prompt
- 5 core tools (grouped related functions)
- 3 example conversations
- Simple decision tree for tool selection

Results:
- Response time: 2-3 seconds
- Tool selection accuracy: 65% → 94%
- User satisfaction: +40%

**Reusable Lesson:**
"Simple, clear, tested" beats "comprehensive, detailed, theoretical" every time.

## Failure #2: Hallucinating Research Assistant

**Date:** 2024-11-22

**Context:**
Built an agent to help with literature reviews. Needed it to find papers, extract key findings, synthesize information.

**What I Did:**
Used chain-of-thought prompting with ReAct pattern to search and synthesize research.

**What Happened:**
Agent would cite papers that *sounded* real but didn't exist. Sometimes would cite real papers but misrepresent their findings.

**Why It Failed:**
1. **No verification step** - Didn't require agent to check citations
2. **Pressure to perform** - Prompt implicitly pressured complete answers
3. **No "I don't know" path** - Agent felt it had to provide citations

**What I Learned:**
- ALWAYS add explicit verification for factual claims
- Give the model permission to say "I couldn't find a source for this"
- Use tool calls for citation retrieval, never let model "remember" papers
- Add a confidence score requirement for each claim

**The Fix:**
Added verification layer:
```
For each claim:
1. Identify the source
2. Verify source exists (via search tool)
3. Quote exact relevant text from source
4. If you cannot verify, say: "I could not find a source for [claim]"

Never cite papers from memory. Always use search tool to verify.
```

Results:
- Hallucinated citations: 40% → 0%
- User trust: Restored
- Completeness: Slightly lower (some claims now flagged as unverified), but this is the right trade-off

**Reusable Lesson:**
For factual tasks, verification isn't optional. Build it into the prompt structure.

## Failure #3: Inconsistent Code Generator

[Continue pattern...]
```

**Why This Matters:**

Documenting failures:
1. Builds trust (you're honest about what doesn't work)
2. Saves others from repeating your mistakes
3. Shows your learning process
4. Demonstrates systematic thinking
5. Creates valuable reference material

**Share Your Failures:**
- Blog posts: "What I Learned From 50 Failed Prompts"
- Twitter threads: "Here's how I broke my production chatbot and fixed it"
- Conference talks: Case studies of real failures

People remember and appreciate honesty more than perfection.

## Summary: Building Authority

**The Five Artifacts:**

1. **5 Reusable Templates** - Demonstrates you can systematize techniques
2. **1 LinkedIn Post** - Shows you can explain concepts simply
3. **Open-Source Repo** - Proves you share value publicly
4. **Failure Documentation** - Reveals your learning process
5. **Continuous Learning** - Stay current with research and practice

**The Authority Formula:**

```
Authority = (Knowledge × Clarity × Generosity) / Complexity

Where:
- Knowledge = Deep understanding of techniques
- Clarity = Ability to explain simply
- Generosity = Willingness to share openly
- Complexity = How complicated you make it seem

Maximize the numerator, minimize the denominator.
```

**Your Next Steps:**

1. **This Week:**
   - Create your first template
   - Write your LinkedIn post
   - Set up GitHub repo

2. **This Month:**
   - Complete all 5 templates
   - Document 3 failures
   - Get feedback from others using your templates

3. **This Quarter:**
   - Write 3 blog posts from your failures
   - Speak at a local meetup
   - Help 10 people improve their prompts

4. **This Year:**
   - Maintain your repo (new templates, community contributions)
   - Publish case studies
   - Build a body of work that helps others

**Remember:** The best experts aren't the ones who hoard knowledge—they're the ones who lift others up.
